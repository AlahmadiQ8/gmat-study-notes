# Integrated Reasoning

Three Steps:
1. **Brainstorm**: Analize the argument to a aparagraph
2. **Template**: Assign each assumption to a paragraph and plug in your transitions
3. **Write**: If you've don't steps 1 and 2, the writing should be a formality

Spend  3-5 minutes before you write:
1. The Conclusion
2. Three assumptions made by the argument
3. For each assumption, a way in which it would not be true

Template:
- **Paragraph 1** Introduction 
- **Paragraph 2** First Assumption and Explanation 
- **Paragraph 3** Second Assumption and Explanation 
- **Paragraph 4** Third Assumption and Explanation 
- **Paragraph 5** Conclusion

**Introduction Paragraph**
- **Sentence 1:** Rephrase the stimulus, especially its conclusion
