# Words Problems

## Rates are Additive

John takes 5 hour to complete a job, Bill takes z hours to complete a job, and together they take y hours to complete a job. 

```
Rate for John = Rj = 1 job / 5 hrs
Rate for Bill = Rb = 1 job / x hrs

Combined Rate = Rj&b = 1/y = 1/5 + 1/x
```

## Weighted Average

At company A, 20% of the females are over 50 years old, 50% of the
males are over 50 years old, and 45% of all the employees are over 50
years old. Are there more males or females in the company?
20% + 50%

```
If same number of females and males, (20% + 50%) / 2 = 35% over 50

 F                                                                      M
(20%)----------------------------(35%)----------------(45%)------------(50%)

Average is closer to the percentage of males over 50, so more males
```

## Use Weighted Average Mapping Strategy 

Ratios are proportional. Leverage that. 

**Example I:** A market research firm surveyed 400 citizens of City A and 600 citizens of City B during a consumer preference study for a new beverage. If 63% of the citizens surveyed from City A and 48% of the citizens surveyed from City B indicated that they enjoyed the new beverage, what percentage of the total number of citizens surveyed enjoyed the new beverage?

```
B <---------------------------> A
48%                           63%

Distance = 63 - 48 = 15

Ratio of citizens A to citizens B = 400/600 = 2/3 

2x + 3x = 5 ==> x = 3

Weighted Average = 48% + 2*3 = %54 

      6               9
  <--------> <---------------->
B <---------------------------> A
48%        54%                63%
```


**Example II:** A girl scout was selling boxes of cookies. In a month, she sold both boxes of chocolate chip cookies ($1.25 each) and boxes of plain cookies ($0.75 each). Altogether, she sold 1585 boxes for a combined value of $1588.75. How many boxes of plain cookies did she sell?

 - A: 0
 - B: 233
 - C: 500
 - D: 695
 - E: 785 --> correct

```
            middle
B <---------------------------> A
$0.75         $1            $1.25

it's middle if they sold 1585 boxes at $1585. each would have sold $792.5. The actual price is tiny $1588.75. hence the closest answer is E
```

## Ratios

Leverage assets! For exmaple, if we have a ratio of 2:5 of apples to oranges. What is the total number of fruits? 

```
The answer MUST be a multiple of 5 + 2 = 7
```

## Back solving 

Start in the middle: 

- A
- B
- C If C is too big, try A or B; if it's too small, Try D or E
- D
- E
