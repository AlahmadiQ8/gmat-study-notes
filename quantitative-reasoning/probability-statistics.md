# Probability and Statistics

## Probability of A or B: 

```
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
```

## Median and Mean

**If terms are evenly spaces, mean = median**

Examples: 
- Consecutive Integers: `{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 19} Mean = Median = 7.5`
- Consecutive Multiples
- Any random even spacing

To find mean and median quickly, average the first and last terms

Example:

```
What is the sum of all even integers from 650 to 750, inclusive? 

There are 50 + 1 even numbers

(Sum of Evens) / 51 = 700 (mean/average) because evenly spaced 
Sum of Evens = 35700
```

## Average vs Sum of Terms

If number of terms does not change,

**% change in Average = % change in Sum**

Over a five-game stretch, Rasheed scored 22, 16, 12, 14, and 21 points.
His actual average was what percent less than his goal of averaging 20
points per game?

```
Goal: 20 points/game * 5 games = 100 points

Actual sum: 85 points

Percentage difference: (85 - 100)/100 * 100% = -15%
```

## Permutations & Combinations

When elements repeat: 

```
N! / ( A! * B! * C! ... )

A, B, C, etc. represent the number of times each item apprears
```


```
Combinations:

N! / ( K! (N - K) )

Permutations: 

N! / (N - K)!
```

## Number of Multiples

```
# Multiples = (Max - Min) / N + 1
```
