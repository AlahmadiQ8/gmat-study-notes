# Probability and Statistics

## Probability of A or B: 

```
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
```

## Median and Mean

**If terms are evenly spaces, mean = median**

Examples: 
- Consecutive Integers: `{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 19} Mean = Median = 7.5`
- Consecutive Multiples
- Any random even spacing

To find mean and median quickly, average the first and last terms

## Average vs Sum of Terms

If number of terms does not change,

**% change in Average = % change in Sum**

Over a five-game stretch, Rasheed scored 22, 16, 12, 14, and 21 points.
His actual average was what percent less than his goal of averaging 20
points per game?

```
Goal: 20 points/game * 5 games = 100 points

Actual sum: 85 points

Percentage difference: (85 - 100)/100 * 100% = -15%
