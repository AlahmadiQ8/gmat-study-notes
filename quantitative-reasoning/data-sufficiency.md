# Data Sufficiency

Pitfalls to avoid:
- I keep falling in the trap of unconciously using information from 
  the first clue even though it's unneeded
- Dont forget to simplify stem (ex. simplify fractions)
- Don't misunderstand the question stem. If it's too complicated, maybe
  you did some thing wrong:
  - e.g `The surface area of a rectangular field` does **not** mean 3d but just 2d rectangular area
- Don't always pick number and consider applying algebra 
- Do Not Fucking forget what the question is asking

------

- Positive or Negative 
- Consider Zero: Neither Positive nor Negative
- Is it Integer
- = vs ()> and <)

------

- **Watch out** of Trap unnessecary clues!
- **Most of The Time** if it's too easy, then it's wrong

------

Ways to eliminate unnessecary clues:
- Think of upper and lower limits

------

- **Use Your Hunch** If it's too easy for C, then it has to be A or B or E

------

-  **Beware of Easy E** if you can get it in less than 30 seconds, then it's soo easy to be true!
-  Predicting new ratio after adding/subscracting: Only possibility when same ratio is added/substracted

------

- Do not repl  ace numbers 

------

- There are Z times as many X as Y" means that the number of X's is equal to Z times the number of Y's
- There are twice as many apples as pineapples => apples = 2 * pineapples

Data Sufficiency has a **strategy game element**. Look for clues in statements:
* If it seems like E, you'd better be sure it's not C
* If it seems like C, you'd better be sure it's not A/B or E
* If it seems like A/B, you'd better be sure it's not D or C
* If it seems like D, you'd better be sure it's not A or B

When an answer choice seems easy:
* Play Devil's Advocate
* Leverage Assets
