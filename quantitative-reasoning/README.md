## Simplifying Calculations 

See `26. Simplifying Calculations`. It has useful techniques. 

```
28 * 15 = 28/2 * 15*2 = 14 * 30 = 420
```

15% of a number 

```
15% of A = 10% of A + (10% of A)/2 
15% 624  = 62.4     + 31.2 = 93.6
```

Another technique 

```
99 * 237 = (100 - 1) * 237 = 23700 - 237 = 23463
```

# Use of Scientific Notation

```
  673 * 19423
= 6.73 * 10^2 * 1.9423 * 10^4
= (<7) * (<2) * 10^6 
< 14 million
```
