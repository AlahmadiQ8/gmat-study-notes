Whena prepositional phrase serves as an adjective, it almost
always must appear beside the noun, noun phrase, or pronoun
that it modifies.

When a prepositional phrase serves as an adverb,
its location may vary.

  seen macaws resting on the branches, with tails trailing like brightly colored splatters of 
  paint on a green canvas.
- **Incorrect:** Bill usually drops any groceries he has brought home from his job on the 
  kitchen table.
- **Correct:** Uponcoming home from work, Bill usually drops any
  groceries on the kitchen table.

  to provide some prison inmates with proper healthcare
  in violation of the constitution.

Participle: a verb form used as an adjective.

Examples:
- The **crying** baby finally fell asleep.
- **Smiling**, the woman left the room.

Participial phrase: a longer modifying phrase starting with a participle

Examples:
- **Bombarded by bullets**, the troops retreated.
- Dogs **trained by professionals** are much more obedient.
- Kit Carson roamed the Rockies and the Southwest, **working as a trapper** 
  and **establishing a reputation as one of the most able mountain men of his time**.

  conservative options, such as money market funds.
